# Control Plots

This subfolder contains the macros and scripts used to generate control plots as the first step of the pâ€“Pb master analysis. 
These plots were intended as quality assurance checks, validating reconstruction algorithms and ensuring data consistency before performing the main physics analysis.

## Contents
- To be updated. Example:
- `control_plots.C` -> ROOT macro to generate basic histograms.
- `print_contents.C` -> Print contents and classes of all files inside `.root` datafile.
- `results/` -> local directory where output plots are stored.

## Usage
To run the macro from bash:
```bash
root -l -q control_plots.C
```

### Notes
- Path to `.root` datafiles may need to be updated depending on the environment.

### To-do
- Update `control_plots.C` code.
- Update `Pb_vs_p.C` code.
- Add updated presentation to repo.
- At the very end, when the remote repo will be completed, we need to update the path/to/datafile in all macros, since the datafile is going to be stored in a directory inside the pPb_master_analysis/ folder.
