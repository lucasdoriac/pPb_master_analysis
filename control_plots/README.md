# Control Plots

This subfolder contains the macros and scripts used to generate control plots as the first step of the pâ€“Pb master analysis. 
These plots were intended as quality assurance checks, validating reconstruction algorithms and ensuring data consistency before performing the main physics analysis.

## Contents
- To be updated. Example:
- `macro_control_plots.C` -> ROOT macro to generate basic histograms.
- `results/` -> local directory where output plots are stored.

## Usage
To run the macro from bash:
```bash
root -l -q control_plots.C
```

### Notes
- Data input paths may need to be updated depending on the environment.

### To-do
- Update main code.
- Add efficiency plots.
- Automate legend and axis labeling.
