# p-Pb Master Analysis

This **ongoing** project consists of a data analysis as part of my _MSc in Physics_ research project and it's results will be used for my final dissertation.
The object of the analysis are two datasets containing data of proton-lead collisions, at center-of-mass nucleon-nucleon energies of 5.02 TeV and 8.16 TeV, performed at the CERN-LHC and measured by the CMS detector. This project is part of the CMS Collaboration and manages CMS Preliminary data.

## Contents

The project currently consists of two sub-folders in order to divide the analysis into smaller tasks.

- `control_plots/` -> Quality-assurance and control plots in order to validate datasets and frameworks.
- `analysis_1/` -> Calculation and analysis of the mean transverse momenta $\langle p_T \rangle$ and multiplicities $N_{ch}$ for three different classes of collision centrality.
